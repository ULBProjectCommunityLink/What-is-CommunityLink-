ABOUT COMMUNITYLINK
CommunityLink (derived from "Community Access Interlink") is a proposed set of conventions and tools for communities or industry to build Open Data Ecology Campus/hubs/exchanges to enable closed loop automation product solutions across multiple stakeholders creating mutual asset pools within a decentralised autonomous network.  

Based on the UCL Open data ecology methodology the interconnecting legal structure/constitution to create a true commercial neutral open ecology system which interlinks proprietary data systems and Solid (social linked data) Linked Data principles, UCL uses a smart product matrix to define the “dynamic interrelationships” of members based on mutual reciprocity and represent this as an algorithm. We call these CODEMAPs (CommunityLink Open data ecology Mutual Asset Pools). Collective wealth & profits maximised through system efficiencies are shared equitably across all members and the community as a whole to create social capital and a regenerative economy.
