What is CommunityLink?

An Open Data Ecology model (ODE) which interlinks proprietal data for the common good

CommunityLink (derived from "Community Access Interlink") is a proposed set of conventions and tools for communities or industry to build Open Data Ecology Campus/hubs/exchanges to enable closed loop automation product solutions across multiple stakeholders creating mutual asset pools within a decentralised autonomous network. We call these CODEMAPs (CommunityLink Open data ecology Mutual Asset Pools).

ABOUT COMMUNITYLINK

Data plays a vital role in driving change – but it can also cement a broken status quo, or worse yet, entrench incremental change when transformative change is needed creating the “illusion of progress,” to quote Reporting 3.0 Steering Board Member Brendan LeBlanc of Ernst & Young in the Reporting 3.0 Data Blueprint Report Executive summary.  "The quality of change, therefore, is driven less by quantification itself, and more by the intermediation of mathematical models and algorithmic metrics as well as the design of data flow architecture and information systems, exposing the resulting information not only to imperatives of ethical inter-action but also to pure dumb human fallibility”. 

CommunityLink is a breakthrough Open Data Ecology (ODE) model that provides true data ownership to address global & local systemic issues via a Design Model for Global Cooperation established and deployed by a representative user established Unidroit style (global legal unification) “Unidata CommunityLink Foundation” (UCL). Leveraging a uniquely engineered decentralised autonomous network the UCL Model provides a structured approach to build a truly connected open data ecology with governance which enables safe inter community data sharing to secure cooperation & efficiency benefits not currently possible.

Based on the UCL Open data ecology methodology the interconnecting legal structure/constitution to create a true commercial neutral open ecology system which interlinks proprietary data systems. UCL uses a smart product matrix to define the “dynamic interrelationships” of members based on mutual reciprocity and represent this as an algorithm. We call these CODEMAPs (CommunityLink Open data ecology Mutual Asset Pools). Collective wealth & profits maximised through system efficiencies are shared equitably across all members and the community as a whole to create social capital and a regenerative economy.

The CommunityLink ODE data flow architecture combined with the ULB smart product matrix methodology enables the design of “Closed loop automation” products across multiple proprietal stakeholders to create beneficial change using algorithms creates mutual asset pools. 

Local & business communities  
    i.	establish their own Hub to act as the Investment manager of their own information, data and associated revenues within an open       data network co-operative. Open Hubs are structured as Not for profit entities which work on behalf of their “proprietal” members,
    manages the operational boundaries and data permission/managed authentications and distributes benefits
    ii.	manage their localised data ownership, security, risk and smart community transition. 
    iii.	enables inter industry & community data sharing and closed loop automation within a decentralised autonomous network to           support pre-defined "smart community, industry or citizen solutions". 
    iv.	create Mutual Asset Pools (MAPs) across multiple proprietal stakeholders to design & deliver solutions system efficiencies,         sustainable profits and collective wealth not currently possible. The Redland smart city project proposal illustrates an initial         smart product matrix CODEMAP commercial opportunity

STANDARDS USED
The CommunityLink platform is working to adopt the following standards:

a. Organisational Structure  
In 1996 the global domain administration infrastructure and governance system e.g. auDA which drives the current day internet did not exist. Similarly today a global open data infrastructure and governance system to protect our data with user established governance does not currently exists as evidenced by the current facebook related problems. CommunityLink (CL) provides an organisational and ICT methodology to create a new standard which enables representative consumer, region, industry, technology and government members to establish an ODE national data administrator (NDA) and global data governance infrastructure within a decentralised autonomous network as the natural next evolutionary step from the supply & demand user established domain administration system

Build around the fundamental principle of citizen ownership of their data with permission based aggregation & access. The role of the CL NDA is to oversee the deployment of the ODE infrastructure, to manage and provide ongoing representative user governance over the transition from human to machine scale change inflexion point we are currently at as part of for the benefit of all.

Technology
Core standards include
•	SOLID (derived from "social linked data") applications are decoupled from the data they produce, users will be able to avoid vendor lock-in by seamlessly switching the apps and personal data storage servers, without losing any data or social connections. Solid provides a tech stack, specification documents, set of servers, a test suite and an ecosystem of apps for our Redland smart city hub need. 

•	MAIDSAFE have developed the SAFE Network a self-configuring and autonomous network designed to manage all our data and communications without any human intervention and without intermediaries. When combined with the Solid ability to decouple content from the application, the Enterprise version of SAFE will enable the Redland hub to manage Council Data permissions or Managed Authentications via a Council Regional Management Platform both within the local community and across the CL safenetwork autonomous network.

•	Hypercat is designed for exposing information about IoT assets over the web. It allows a server to provide a set of resources to a client, each with a set of semantic annotations. Implementers are free to choose or invent any set of annotations to suit their needs.

Other open standards under review
A number of other key platforms are being examined as standards for an open data ecology. Examples of existing open standards under review include data models based on CitySDK, data platforms based on CKAN, APIs based on the FIWARE NGSI API framework which support and information discovery standards like Hypercat.

Social Capital Investment Trust – “Maximising profits through system efficiencies”

To eliminate the need for duplicated capital raising activities by multiple Project stakeholders we have designed the Social Capital Investment Trust (SCIT) collective investment methodology. This enables the CL consortium to present a much stronger collaborative investment case and also in a way which removes a conflict of interest for partners to participate and secure commercial returns in creating a revolutionary Open data ecology as a public infrastructure in perpetuity.

The role of the SCIT is to secure the IP, build the core UCL system asset on behalf of a User established Governance Foundation and fund & connect supply and demand partners to create an internal bank of funds to fund the CommunityLink ODE model roll out globally.

The SCIT design is an elegantly simple and sophisticated Portfolio Asset Management design incorporating three funds and an Integrated Portfolio strategy which has been integrated with the Github platform as pinned repositories to enable the project development and fund core stakeholders as follows:

   a.	Portfolio Integration Asset (PIA) Fund – System IP repository
   
      The PIA funds github repository secures and holds core IP which is licensed to the Knowledge Integration fund 
      
   b.	Knowledge Integration fund (KIF) Development environment
   
      Capital is raised to this fund to i. build the core UCL system asset on behalf of a User established Governance Foundation ii.           seed the other funds 
      
   c.	Strategic Investment Fund  -  (SIF) Supply and demand partners licensing & funding
   
      Provides licenses and funding to supply and demand partners to i. fork and customise their user established ODE hubs and                 established the Governance Foundation to enable their members to access the CL open data ecology

i.	Showcase 

The Redland smart city project proposal illustrates an initial smart product matrix CODEMAP commercial opportunity. 

ii.	Consortium partners

The objective is to bring and consortium bring local and international co creation partners around the Redland Smart city Codemap proposal to secure their pre agreed role, capital & revenue allocation and define their cash and in kind contribution to support a PM’s Department smart city grant application for $5ml and matching $5-25ml investment case.

iii.	The Redland smart product matrix

This enables us to define the
    1.	mix of platforms across the various partners to build our Redland Codemap prototype. 
    2.	members, functionality required and operation interrelationships
    3.	commercial interrelationships for legal agreement within a closed loop environment
    4.	mutual asset pool algorithm which defines how efficiency benefits are shared systemically across the community as a whole 

Contributing to Project CommunityLink

We invite potential CL Consortium stakeholders to commence discussions to secure their pre agreed role, capital & revenue allocation and define their cash and in kind contribution to support a PM’s Department smart city grant application for $5ml and matching $5-25ml investment case.
