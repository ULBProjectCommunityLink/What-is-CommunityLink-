# What-is-CommunityLink-
An Open Data Ecology (ODE) which interlinks proprietal data for the common good

CommunityLink (derived from "Community Access Interlink") is a proposed set of conventions and tools for communities or industry to build Open Data Ecology Campus/hubs/exchanges to enable closed loop automation product solutions across multiple stakeholders creating mutual asset pools within a decentralised autonomous network. We call these CODEMAPs (CommunityLink Open data ecology Mutual Asset Pools).

ABOUT COMMUNITYLINK
CommunityLink is a breakthrough Open Data Ecology (ODE) model that provides true data ownership to address global & local systemic issues via a Design Model for Global Cooperation established and deployed by a representative user established Unidroit style (global legal unification) “Unidata CommunityLink Foundation” (UCL). Leveraging a uniquely engineered decentralised autonomous network the UCL Model provides a structured approach to build a truly connected open data ecology with governance which enables safe inter community data sharing to secure cooperation & efficiency benefits not currently possible.

Based on the UCL Open data ecology methodology the interconnecting legal structure/constitution to create a true commercial neutral open ecology system which interlinks proprietary data systems and Solid (social linked data) Linked Data principles, UCL uses a smart product matrix to define the “dynamic interrelationships” of members based on mutual reciprocity and represent this as an algorithm. We call these CODEMAPs (CommunityLink Open data ecology Mutual Asset Pools). Collective wealth & profits maximised through system efficiencies are shared equitably across all members and the community as a whole to create social capital and a regenerative economy.

UCL provides 
1.	a structured approach to build Campuses/pods/hubs through the safenetwork with the initial interconnecting legal structure/constitution to create a true commercial neutral open ecology system which interlinks proprietary data systems
2.	the organisational method to build to a Unidroit style governance outcome necessary to enable a true autonomous network free of human intervention
3.	an AU Smart city business case and Redland smaert city CODEMAP practical start point to deliver to an existing client need/spec
