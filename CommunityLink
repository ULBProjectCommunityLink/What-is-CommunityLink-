CommunityLink (derived from "Community Access Interlink") is a proposed set of conventions and tools for communities or industry to build Open Data Ecology Campus/hubs/exchanges to enable closed loop automation product solutions across multiple stakeholders creating mutual asset pools within a decentralised autonomous network.  Based on the UCL Open data ecology methodology the interconnecting legal structure/constitution to create a true commercial neutral open ecology system which interlinks proprietary data systems and Solid (social linked data) Linked Data principles, UCL uses a smart product matrix to define the “dynamic interrelationships” of members based on mutual reciprocity and represent this as an algorithm. Collective wealth & profits maximised through system efficiencies are shared equitably across all members and the community as a whole to create social capital and a regenerative economy.
